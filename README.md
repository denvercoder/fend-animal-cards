This is my animal card game I am making to help my daughter learn to talk.

- Press the right or left arrows to switch to a new animal.
- When you click on the Animal it says its name.
- In the future I will be adding the animal sounds and also I will be coming out with new categories like:
    - Vehicles
    - People
    - Jobs
    etc.
